## About me
Hey there! I'm a passionate programmer with experience in Java ☕ and Python 🐍. My proficiency leans towards Java, but I'm continually honing my skills in both languages. I'm also familiar with several other programming languages, though I acknowledge there's always room for improvement.

## Project Experience
While I've embarked on projects involving popular frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and Flutter, I admit that I've faced challenges on the journey and haven't completed some of them due to their steep learning curves. However, I'm determined to tackle these technologies head-on in the future and bring my projects to fruition. 😅
