# Hi and welcome to my profile! :wave:
## :information_desk_person: About me
- I'm a 18 yo with 2 years of experience of coding. :smile_cat:
- I started with Java:coffee: and nowadays I'm still learning Pyhton:snake: and I quite know Java. I also know other programming languages.
- I've done projects with frameworks like React, Angular or Flutter but unfortunately I've never finished none of them due the high learning curve but in a future maybe I'll learn some of them really:sweat_smile:
- In summary I'm a novice programmer with spirit to learn and overcome about this world of coding.:fist:
- I'm from Spain [:es:] so please forgive me if my level of English is not enough. I'm struggling to improve as much as I can.:muscle:
- Also I wish to improve my music skills with DAWs like FL Studio, the only one I've payed but I chose the Fruity version so I can't do much but I'm not qualified to play no instrument but the recorder. So yeah in a future I wish to play the piano or the guitar.:musical_keyboard::musical_note:
